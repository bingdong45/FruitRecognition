# üçé Fruit Recognition Website
link: https://fruitrecognition.streamlit.app/

This repository hosts the code for a Fruit Recognition Website built with Streamlit. Users can upload an image of a fruit, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model classifies the fruit into one of the predefined categories.

## Features
* Upload images of fruits via the web interface or take a picture using your device camera
* Get instant predictions using a trained CNN model
* User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit

## Tech Stack
* Frontend: Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
* Backend: PyTorch-based CNN for image classification.
* Languages: Python

## Model Architecture
This classification model is implemented using a CNN that contains 5 convolutional layers each followed by a max pooling layer, and one fully connected output layer at the end

## Setup Instructions
1. Go to your working directory and clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/bingdong45/FruitRecognition.git
2.
